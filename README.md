# Soundifically
**Free and open-source ear-training app for musicians, sound engineers and audio enthusiasts**



### How it began
This work is a result of deep passion and my constant strive for understanding and strengthening the connection to music on both analytical and emotional levels. It originally started as a project developed during a multimedia-themed class at the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology under a patronage of Dolby Laboratories. As a musician and producer I've always acknowleged the importance of having a perceptive and acute ear, so having gained valuable programming experience I later decided to continue the idea on a much bigger scale, and to turn it into something any fellow music enthusiast can benefit from. 
I've also based my masters thesis on this exact concept, and I'm currently investigating the effects of an automated ear-training on the hearing ability.



### The app
The result of my endeavours is Soundifically, an app designed to help anyone passionate about music to get the most out of every sound by expanding their hearing horizons, improving fine detail perception and sensitizing their ears to differentiate between any imaginable tone or frequency.
An extensive selection of varied exercises is in the works, with the goal of allowing anyone to tailor their learning experience according to personal needs and preference.



### Current state
Soundifically is currently in the beta stage - with enough features and content to allow for several different (and hopefully fruitful) training sessions, though definitely lacking polish, customizability and scope of a full release. You can grab the latest release [here](https://github.com/Xenvy/Soundifically/releases/tag/v0.4.0-beta).



### Installation instructions

**Windows**

Simply unzip to your desired location.

**Android**

Open your file explorer of choice and find the downloaded .apk file. Try to open it, an install prompt should appear. Depending on your security settings you may then need to enable app installs from unknown sources to proceed with the installation.



### How to use custom sounds
Soundfically allows you to train using your favorite music and sounds (at least for the most part). To use this feature you need your tracks to be in either .mp3 or .wav format.
If you are on Windows, navigate to *C:/Users/[your_username]/Appdata/LocalLow/X3n-V Studio/Soundifically* and create 3 folders named "Compression Exercise", "EQ Exercise" and "Level Difference Exercise" if they aren't there already. You can then place your files in an appropriate folder, depending on which exercise you want them to appear in (files in EQ exercise are shared with Cutoff frequency exercise). If you can't see the Appdata folder, try typing "%appdata%" in Windows search bar.

On Android the folders should go into  */storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.X3nVStudio.Soundifically/files/* .
